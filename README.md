Compiling:
============
1. Download Sourcery from http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/lite-edition/
(ARM Processors/EABI Release).
2. Unpack it to home directory (~/)
3. Clone this github.
4. It seems logical (always use Compile-clean for stock or Compile-CM-clean for CM7 [everytime it will produce three packages but only desired version will be right]. noclean for fast compiling [delete .o of modified files + built.in in modded folder).
5. At the end files will be in ~/Ace-I-Kernel/* (tar for Odin, zip for CWM).
6. Done!
